# @tailor-cms/ce-video-manifest

Shared element definition for the **Video** content element in [Tailor CMS](https://github.com/tailor-cms/author).

Declares the element type, display name, UI configuration and initial state. The authoring, end-user and server packages all build on it, so it is the only package that has to be understood to know what the element *is*.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @tailor-cms/ce-video-manifest
```

## Usage

Content elements are normally registered with Tailor through the element
registry rather than imported directly, but the package can be consumed on its
own:

```ts
import manifest, { type ElementData } from '@tailor-cms/ce-video-manifest';

manifest.type;       // 'VIDEO'
manifest.initState(); // initial element data
```

## Element

| Property | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Video |
| Type | `VIDEO` |
| Icon | [`mdi-video`](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/) |
| Composite | No |

## Packages

This element ships as four packages, published together from the
[`ce-video`](https://github.com/tailor-cms/ce-video) repository:
